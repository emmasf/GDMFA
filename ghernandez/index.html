					<p>The voice of the music room found its inspiration in classical music, jazz, mid-century modern design, music theory, and beyond. I developed a series of didactic and decorative posters that aimed to convey the movement, drama and emotion of music. Simultaneously, I received feedback from music students, music educators, and advisers and continued to refine and explore the visual language of the posters.</p>

				<div class="col-md-6 twocolumncopy">
					<p>I took inspiration from the notes an staff in music and found that abstracting music to lines and dots provided a playful and flexible way to explore movement, rhythm, and structure. I incorporated naive, hand-drawn lines and writing as a way to convey the expressive nature of music. At the same time, these hand-drawn elements kept the visual language of the posters lively, dynamic, and approachable.</p>

                    <p>The composer series was born out of a desire to create engaging and approachable portraits of famous composers. They set the tone for the classroom by providing decorative, large-scale art that immerses students in the world of classical music. Though these posters are not strictly educational, they hint at the sound and personality of each of the composers. Students begin to get a sense of what the composers' music sounds like and begin to distinguish between composers and periods of music.

                    <p>The series takes its inspiration from the composers’ hair, which is suggestive of their period, style, and personality. Bach, for instance, wears a Baroque wig. It is ornate, controlled, decorative, and its curls create a repetitive pattern that is at once simple and complex. Many of these characteristics are true of Bach’s music. It balances a straightforward simplicity with an ornate complexity. In illustrating the five composers, I used the lines in their hair and names as a way suggest their music.</p>

                    <div class="essayintro"><p>I first learned to read music at the age of ten. I was in fifth grade and my mom had signed me up for piano lessons. For years my mom had spoken of her love of the piano, of how she would sit by the piano in her childhood home and make up songs. She described her childhood compositions as something akin to Bartók, “Better,” she claimed, because “What was that noise?!” I envisioned her pounding on the piano keys as the household winced. My mother, the prodigy. Her biggest problem was, of course, that she never learned to play an instrument. The only thing standing between her and her dream of becoming a musician was musical ability.</p>
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="read-more-content essaybody">
    <p>My mom’s unfulfilled childhood dream would soon be lived out through me. She signed me up for private lessons and her plan was underway. The thought of taking piano lessons meant very little to me at the time. I saw it as an opportunity to be special. I took piano lessons. Somehow that made me more distinguished and interesting. I learned to read music and slowly moved on to  playing songs. Around this time, things began to go awry. I started off with easy tunes and then just seemed to stay there. Week after week, I would arrive at my piano teacher’s house for music lessons. Week after week, I would play the same song, having made no progress whatsoever. I knew I was expected to be getting better, yet this concept completely alluded me. I rarely practiced outside of my lesson and when I did, the notes were clumsy and unnatural. I was disappointed that playing didn’t come easily yet the adage “practice makes perfect” meant absolutely nothing to me. It was becoming evident that I didn’t have it, talent, that is.</p>
    
    <p>A year later I began playing violin in my elementary school orchestra. My endeavors with the piano dwindled and finally died. I was more excited to be playing with a group. My friends were in the orchestra and the thought of creating something with them was new and thrilling. I distinguished myself as one of the better violinists early on. I sat second chair in the First Violin section. Sitting in first chair was a girl named Andrea Lam. Andrea had been playing violin for years and it was clear that she was the best musician in the class. This of course meant that I could only go downhill from second chair. As the school year went on I descended to my proper place in the orchestra. I was demoted from second chair to third, third to fourth, so on and so on, retreating further and further back in the section, and into oblivion.</p>
    
    <p>My lack of musical ability never fazed me. I wasn’t ashamed that I wasn’t the best, I was just excited to be playing music with people. There was something about the way the harmonies would come together that bewildered me. How I could play a part, and someone else could play a part, and someone else could play a part, and suddenly we were playing a song together. We were moving parts coming together to make a greater whole. I loved the full sound of the orchestra. There were moments when we would be playing through a song and I would think, “Hey! We’re doing it! And it sounds great!” It was magic.<p>
    
    <p>It was this magic that kept me in orchestra through middle school and high school. I was average at best and yet I felt so much pride dazzling audiences with numbers like “Doodlin’ Digits” and “Fiddling A-Round.”  “This is what I have been waiting for,” I would think on concert nights. I would sit excitedly in my chair, warm up, wait for the note to tune our instruments, and beam with pride as we played the concert. It was exhilarating. In these moments I felt that I was a part of something bigger than myself. We were creating art, and giving it to the world. Here we were, mere teenagers, moving people with our interpretations of Christmas classics.</p>
    
    <p>The great thing about having to go to orchestra every day, was that I had no choice but to get better. I loved playing, but I had the same problem with the violin that I had had with the piano. The notes didn’t come easily and I would be damned if getting better required that I practice. But here, by the sheer act showing up, I was becoming a better musician. I joined the varsity orchestra towards the end of my sophomore year of high school. They were in the middle of learning an arrangement of Dvořák’s “New World Symphony” and I had to catch up in order to play in the next concert. My first time playing through the music was like learning to read for the first time. I had forgotten what music looked or sounded like. On the first day of rehearsal, I had all the dexterity of a newborn baby. I kept my head down, sat in the back of the Second Violin section, and slowly caught up to the class.</p>
    
    <p>As the concert drew near we were playing through more and more of the song. We were putting the finishing touches on our performance and were able to play through the piece without major mistakes. The first time I heard us play through the song stunned me. The unfolding melodies, the loud timpani, the stillness and grandeur of “New World Symphony” moved me. I felt privileged to get to play the piece for an audience, to fill the stage with such beautiful, dynamic, full sounds. I was swept away. I continued to have this experience over the years. Over the years, my heart ached with Elgar’s “Nimrod,” soared with Holt’s “Planets”, and danced with Tchaikovsky’s “String Serenade.” The music was greater than me, but I was allowed to be a part of it. I loved the feeling of being a part of something and a creator of something.</p>
    
    <p>I stopped playing violin after high school. After eight years of playing music, I learned the following; I am a lousy musician and I love playing music. Something strange happens for the length of a performance. For the length of the song there is an exchange that is at once private and public. First there is this feeling that you, as an individual, belong to something, that together with the orchestra, you are creating something of value. You are all in it together, even if only for the length of the song. Then, there is the feeling that you belong to something much greater than you or the orchestra. You are a part of the music. You are just a vehicle, but the music cannot exist without you. The piece cannot be played without your hands to play it. At the same time there is something deeply personal about playing music. You do it for you, because you enjoy it, you put your heart into it and get lost in it. You close your eyes, you move your body, you are moved. Finally there is the public performance. You are performing for an audience. You are doing something that you love, for someone else. You are giving the audience a moment to stop and enjoy the moment, enjoy the music, enjoy life. You are giving something of value to a group of people.</p>
    
    <p>Over the years I’ve realized that my memories of being in orchestra still ring true to me. The feeling I had of belonging to something great, of wanting to inspire others, of wanting to create commonalities between people by giving them something to enjoy and reflect on, I think about these things now as a designer. I think the connection between music and design comes from the desire to live a life that is enriching and the desire to share something meaningful. Design, like music, enhances our lives, asks questions, motivates us, and enriches our experiences. Design asks audiences to stop, rest, think and feel.</p>
    
    <p>When I played violin, it didn’t matter that I wasn’t the best in the orchestra. It didn’t matter that I was playing in a high school auditorium. It didn’t matter that we didn’t matter. What mattered was that we were participating in something we cared about and believed in, something moving. We weren’t looking to change the world with our art. We were simply doing something we cared about and sharing it with others on the chance that somebody would care about it too. I feel this way about design. There is this sentiment among designers that we can change the world through design. It is at once an inflated and noble idea. To say that I am going to create something “world changing” as a designer is an exaggeration but at the core of this sentiment is the notion that I want to do something that matters.</p>
    
    <p>For me, what matters is the every day. I look at how design can enhance how people live their lives on a daily basis. I look at what people do, think, and look at every day and consider how that experience can be made more practical, special, unexpected, or beautiful. Like my time with the orchestra, the size of the room doesn’t matter. The caliber of the orchestra doesn’t matter. What matters is that I am connecting to something I love and trying to connect to others. If, as a designer, I am given the opportunity to create something that helps someone, makes someone feel understood, or does something good, I am fulfilled. The common denominator between my life as a designer and my life as a musician is the desire to create something of resonance. I may not be the best violinist or the best designer. I don’t claim to be, and not being the best doesn't bother me. What I want is to keep playing, keep making, keep giving, this is what moves me and fulfills me. At the end of the day I am just an average violin player, playing my heart out, and that is enough for me.</p>
    
    <p>I often think about how early on my imaginary kids will start playing music. How I will sign them up for a music lesson and tell them about my life as a young violinist. I will ask them to live my unlived dream of becoming a musician. They will play music for a few years, and then follow their own path. In the end, it won’t really matter if they stick to music. What will matter is that they will have experienced the act of making music and will have learned to be moved and inspired. Playing music taught me to care about something, taught me what it means to be a part of something, taught me to give and receive.</p>
